# Format: Each line should one one string and (optionally) one context detail.
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored as comments.
# STRING|CONTEXT
#
# Use the pipe '|' character as the delimiter to separate the two items. You
# cannot use the '|' pipe character in your string. If the '|' delimiter is not
# present, no context details will be passed. If additional '|' delimiters are
# found, they and the subsequent text will be ignored.
#
# Context details are of the format textgroup:type:objectid:property.
#
# The textgroup determines the category of the string and the type is where
# the string originates. You can further denote a specific object ID (e.g. node
# ID), if appropriate, and then the final property item can be used if more
# specificity is still required. Generally, a simple textgroup:type context is
# sufficient.

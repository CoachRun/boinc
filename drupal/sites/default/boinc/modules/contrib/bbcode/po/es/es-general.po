"<p>\n"
" BBCode allows you to specify formatting rules for your text,\n"
" even if you are not allowed to use HTML in your posts. BBCode\n"
" originated from the forum software named PHPBB, and Drupal has a\n"
" special implementation of it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
" In BBCode terms, you use \"tags\" to add formatting to your text. Every\n"
" tag is enclosed in [ and ]. If you want to mark some region in\n"
" your text, you need to use an opening tag and a closing tag. Closing\n"
" tags start with [/, as you will see in the examples below. If you\n"
" mistype a tag or forget to close it, you will not get the desired\n"
" formatting.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Simple text formatting</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
" BBCode allows you to make some parts of your texts stand out from the\n"
" context by adding <strong>[b]</strong>old, <strong>[i]</strong>talic\n"
" and <strong>[u]</strong>nderlined formatting to them. The\n"
" <strong>[color]</strong> and <strong>[size]</strong> tags allow you to\n"
" change the color and size of portions of the text you enclose with\n"
" these tags. Both require a parameter (which colour or how big) that is\n"
" suffixed to the name of the tag by an equals sign (example below).\n"
" You should not repeat the parameter in the closing tag!\n"

" to set the font size between 10 and 30, 10 being the smallest size.\n"
